\section{Work Experience}
\datedsubsection{\href{https://www.bytedance.com/en}{\textbf{ByteDance} (Parent company of TikTok)}}{Shenzhen, China}
\datedsubsection{\textit{Backend Software Engineer \textbf{Full-time}, TikTok E-commerce Fulfillment Group}}{07/2021 -- 10/2023}
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.2ex]
    \item \textbf{Merchant Fulfillment}: \textit{Core developer}. Supported the construction of the multi-end capabilities for 
    merchant fulfillment and launched 23+ large and medium-sized projects. The business order volume has grown from 56k to 
    10 million.
    \item \textbf{OpenAPI}: \textit{Business owner}. Reviewed the historical architecture, tracked online issues, identified 
    and promptly addressed 16 historical bugs. Based on software development principles, took the lead in formulating interface 
    change specifications.
    \item \textbf{Stability Construction}: \textit{Business owner}. Completed the basic construction of business problem 
    troubleshooting tools, including the full-link tool reporting SDK, data cleaning, and full-scenario data dashboard, etc. 
    For online problem solving, it saved 75\% of human resources (21 people to 5 people).
    \item \textbf{Achievement}
      \begin{itemize}
          \item[$\circ$] \textbf{Annual performance appraisal: \textit{Exceed Expectation} and promoted} (top 1\%)
          \item[$\circ$] Global E-Commerce \textit{Spot Bonus} Award (Outstanding Job Performance, top 3\%)
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Experience}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{Fulfillment Decision System and Configuration SDK Project} @ByteDance}{09/2022 -- 11/2022}
\datedsubsection{\textit{Project Owner. Technologies: Golang, KiteX, RocketMQ, SDK, RPC, Metrics, Grafana}}{}
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.2ex]
    \item Implemented an action decision system that can encapsulate business decision logic, achieve configurability, 
    support grayscale release mechanism and exception rollback.
    \item Converted 25 business rules into rule expressions in the MVP version and designed a rule engine to complete 
    the logical calculation of the regular expression.
    \item Used the company's basic component TCC to configure rules, provide rule management, and read and write 
    capabilities. Completed the configuration management of business rules.
    \item Designed an action verification service based on the rule engine, which could offer two integration methods, 
    SDK and RPC, preventing single-point issues.
    \item \textbf{Result}: 3 months after being launched, access to SDK QPS: 1.1k, access to RPC QPS: 115 (B-side business).
\end{itemize}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{Fulfillment Oncall Tool Efficiency Improvement Project} @ByteDance}{12/2022 -- 03/2023}
\datedsubsection{\textit{Project Owner. Technologies: Golang, KiteX, SDK, ElasticSearch, Hive, RocketMQ, Metrics, Grafana}}{}
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.2ex]
    \item Abstracted the key actions in each business, classified key actions according to e-commerce scenarios, and designed 
    common reporting business data for each key action.
    \item Designed a general business data reporting SDK for low-cost access to business services. Pushed the reported data 
    to ES via RocketMQ.
    \item Exported ES data to the data analysis platform through Hive for PM and operations to perform data analysis.
    \item \textbf{Result}: Based on the data reported by ES, SDE can quickly check the full-scenario data of the order based on the key ID. 
    For online problem solving, it saved 75\% of human resources (21 people to 5 people).
