\datedsubsection{Master of Science in Software Engineering}{08/2024 -- now}

\datedsubsection{\textbf{\href{https://www.nenu.edu.cn}{Northeast Normal University}}}{Changchun, China}
\datedsubsection{B.Eng. in Software Engineering, Overall GPA: 88.16/100}{09/2017 -- 06/2021}

\section{Work Experience}
\datedsubsection{\href{https://www.bytedance.com/en}{\textbf{ByteDance} (TikTok's parent company)}}{Guangdong, China}
\datedsubsection{\textit{Backend Software Engineer, Full-Time, TikTok E-commerce Fulfillment Platform}}{07/2021 -- 09/2023}
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.2ex]
    \item \textbf{Merchant Fulfillment}: supported the construction of the multi-end capabilities for merchant fulfillment 
    as a core developer in the team; participated in various MVP and large-scale horizontal projects.
    \item \textbf{OpenAPI}: reviewed the historical architecture, tracked online issues, identified and promptly addressed 
    16 historical bugs; based on software development principles, took the lead in formulating interface change specifications.
    \item \textbf{Stability Construction}: took responsibility for the construction of business issue troubleshooting tools and 
    success rate dashboards; completed infrastructure projects, including the full-link tool reporting SDK, data cleaning, and 
    full-scenario data dashboard, etc.
    \item \textbf{Achievement}: 
      \begin{itemize}
          \item[$\circ$] \textit{Exceed Expectation} Performance Promotion (top 1\%)
          \item[$\circ$] Global E-Commerce \textit{Spot Bonus} Award (Outstanding Job Performance, top 3\%)
      \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\section{Project Experience}
\datedsubsection{\textbf{Fulfillment Decision System and Configuration SDK Project}, ByteDance}{09/2022 -- 11/2022}
\datedsubsection{\textit{Aimed at designing a decision system that can encapsulate business decision logic, achieve configurability, 
and support a gray release mechanism and abnormal rollback.}}{}
\begin{itemize}[parsep=0.2ex]
    \item \textbf{Rule Engine}: focused on designing a rule engine that incorporates rule factors, rule expression strategies, 
    and rule decisions, which is used for supporting the differential handling of business rules and facilitating decision-making.
    \item \textbf{Rule Configuration}: considered the minimal cost of implementing the MVP version, opting to use the lightweight 
    TCC components for rule-based configuration management.
    \item \textbf{Action Verification Service}: designed an action verification service based on the rule engine, which could offer 
    two integration methods, SDK and RPC, preventing single-point issues.
    \item \textbf{Result}: 
      \begin{itemize}
          \item[$\circ$] converged merchant fulfillment business decision-making logic and supported the low-cost integration of 
          new rules in the future.
          \item[$\circ$] 3 months after being launched, access to SDK QPS: 1.1k, access to RPC QPS: 115 (B-side business).
      \end{itemize}
